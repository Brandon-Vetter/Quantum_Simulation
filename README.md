Quantum Simulation
===

# Introduction
This program simulates a eletron moving through free space as a probility field using the FDTD method.  It can simulate the shrodinger equation for a particle, and it can simulate eletrical potential fields.

# Installation
## Dependancies
In the future there will be a script for this, as for now, here are the required python libraries that you will need to install:

| packages |
|---|
| numpy |
| matplotlib |
| numba |
| yaml |

# How to run
To run the program, it is best to start out with one of the examples.  To run an example, open the python file in spyder (or whatever python code editor you are using) and run the program.
